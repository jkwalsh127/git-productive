        This project was a collaboration between myself and two of my peers. The purpose was to hone our development skills by building and deploying a full-stack web application from scratch. We wanted to structure the app in an MVC architecture, so that it was functional, interactive, and able to store a users data between sessions. The final product showcases an ability to program useful front-end functionality, an attractive and userfriendly UX/UI, and an efficient back-end equipped with models, routes, controllers, and a database.
